# Binary to Decimal

Converts Binary to Decimal



## Project Desription

The following projects converts binary numbers to decimals. 
Teh program allows users to enter upto eight numbers and then converts these binary values into their decimal equivalent. Thsi helps one understand the basics of conversions, base 2 / binary operations.



### The said project works under the following constraints
- Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
- Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function to use.



## Basic Requirements of the Program (User Stories)

- [ ] User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
- [ ] User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
- [ ] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered
